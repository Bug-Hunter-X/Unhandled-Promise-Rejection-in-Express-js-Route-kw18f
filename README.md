# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle potential errors within asynchronous operations within route handlers.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that uses a placeholder asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation()`). If this operation fails, the error is only logged to the console, without a proper response being sent to the client or any mechanism for graceful degradation.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to properly handle errors using a `.catch()` block within the promise chain. It sends an appropriate error response to the client if the asynchronous operation fails, providing a better user experience and more robust application behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `bug.js`.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Simulate an error in the `someAsyncOperation()` function (e.g., make it throw an exception).
5. Observe that the error is only logged to the console, with no response sent to the client.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 with `bugSolution.js` and observe the improved error handling.
